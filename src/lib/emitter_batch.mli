(** Add a batch in front of an emitter.

    The batch accumulates signals until it's full or too old, at which points
    all the accumulated signals are emitted at once. Pushing into a batch is
    generally very fast (amortized), in most cases; the slow path is only when
    the batch needs to be emitted.
